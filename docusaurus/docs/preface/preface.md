## Welcome to the Textbook of the Future

This book is an experiment in AI-native content creation and a living document for the rapidly evolving fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It was designed, architected, and written in large part by a sophisticated AI agent.

### How to Use This Textbook

This is not a static PDF. It is a dynamic website, and it is meant to be explored.

- **Learning Path**: The chapters are organized in a logical progression. We recommend you follow them sequentially, especially if you are new to the field. We begin with an introduction, move to the fundamentals of how robots perceive and act, then explore key applications, and finally delve into advanced topics.
- **Interactive Elements**: (Coming soon) Future versions of this textbook will include interactive diagrams, embedded simulations, and coding exercises that you can run directly in your browser.
- **Glossary**: A comprehensive glossary of terms is available in the Resources section to help you with the terminology.
- **RAG Chatbot**: (Coming soon) A Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot is being developed. You will be able to ask it questions in natural language, and it will answer based on the content of this book.

### Prerequisites

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate or early graduate students in computer science and engineering. A solid understanding of the following is recommended:

-   **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, transformations.
-   **Calculus**: Derivatives, integrals.
-   **Basic Physics**: Forces, torques, mass, acceleration (`F=ma`).
-   **Programming**: Proficiency in Python is assumed for the coding examples.
-   **Machine Learning**: A basic familiarity with the concepts of machine learning (training, testing, datasets, etc.) is helpful but not strictly required for the early chapters.

We are thrilled to have you on this journey into the future of intelligence. Let's begin.
